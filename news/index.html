	<h2 id="d20230408">Please show support for Monkeybrains - Posted: Saturday, 2023-04-08, Updated 2023-04-16</h2>
	<h3>Short Story</h3>
	<p>Monkeybrains is a great local company providing San Franciscans with independent, affordable internet access since 1998. Support this company providing working class jobs to local residents and keeping a tiny bit of light industry in the Mission.</p>
	<p>napsugar will be on hiatus until some sort of compromise can be made between Monkeybrains and members of the <a href="https://missiongreenway.org/">Mission Greenway</a> project. A strong showing of community support for Monkeybrains and the light industrial heritage of the Mission may facilitate a more collaborative relationship between the greenway project and the businesses surrounding the parcel they are focused on.</p>
	<h3>Write an email by April 19th or attend the hearing at the Board of Appeals on Wednesday, April 26th, 5pm at City Hall, room 416</h3>
	<p>Write an email in support of Monkeybrains and creative, collaborative use of the disputed parcel at the center of this controversy. An email message should reference the Appeal Number 23-008 (in the subject line) and mention why perhaps the board should value your input, e.g. ties to the Mission community; proximity to the parcel; experiences either with monkeybrains or the greenway group, etc.</p>
	<p>email can be sent to boardofappeals@sfgov.org</p>
	<p>Here's a groovy link that will set the address and populate the subject line for you:

	<p>You can also attend the meeting via zoom and info about that can be found here: <a href="https://sf.gov/meeting/april-26-2023/board-appeals-hearing-april-26-2023">https://sf.gov/meeting/april-26-2023/board-appeals-hearing-april-26-2023</a></p>
	<h3>More Story</h3>
	<p>Until ownership is established for this parcel or the city takes responsibility for it via eminent domain, the adjacent stakeholders need to take care of it as has been done since the railroad service ended 30+ years ago. I think Monkeybrains and Greenway could work together to make this a powerful spot in the Mission while ownership/responsibility remains unsettled.</p>
	<p>Write in support of a responsible, 20+ year old San Francisco company taking the initiative to maintain and improve this parcel while serving the local community.</p>
	<p>Here's what the spot looks like on google maps: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BxL3PqtyE1GjJpqS8">https://goo.gl/maps/BxL3PqtyE1GjJpqS8</a></p>
	<p>Here is the building permit to replace the janky chain link fence on the 22nd St. end that greenway is appealing: <a href="https://dbiweb02.sfgov.org/dbipts/default.aspx?page=Permit&PermitNumber=202303022910">https://dbiweb02.sfgov.org/dbipts/default.aspx?page=Permit&PermitNumber=202303022910</a></p>
	<h3>Suggestion for Letter</h3>
	<p>I support adjacent stakeholders taking the initiative to use, maintain and improve parcel 36. I trust Monkeybrains as a 20+ year old San Francisco business to be a reliable and responsible partner with other interested parties, including Mission Kids Co-op and members of the greenway project, to ensure the safety, cleanliness, security and beautification of the disputed parcel while its legal disposition plays out. I sincerely hope that unless and until the City acts to take responsibility for the parcel or determines another responsible party that the adjacent stakeholders are allowed to take responsible actions to secure and maintain it.</p>
